# oo-many-many-practice

# Here's our domain:
  * Patient
  * Doctor
  * Appointment

# How is this modeled?
  * An appointment belongs_to a doctor
  * An appointment belongs_to a patient
  * A patient has_many appointments
  * A doctor has_many appointments
  * A patient has_many doctors through appointments
  * A doctor has_many patients through appointments

==============================================================

# OBJECTIVES
  * Draw this domain on a whiteboard or http://awwapp.com/
  * Build out the three classes and files from scratch (keep in mind the relationships)
  * Think about how the classes will interact -- how does a doctor know about their patients?
  * Use attr_reader, attr_writer, & attr_accessor
  * Create a run file with a single point of entry
  * Maintain single source of truth for all classes

==============================================================
