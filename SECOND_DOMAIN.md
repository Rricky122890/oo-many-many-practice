# Here's our domain:
  * Donation
  * Donor
  * Charity

# How is this modeled?
  * What's the relationship between a Donor and an Donation?
  * A Charity and an Donation?
  * A Donor and a Charity?

==============================================================

### OBJECTIVES
  * Draw this domain on a whiteboard or http://awwapp.com/
  * Build out the three classes and files from scratch (keep in mind the relationships)
  * Think about how the classes will interact -- how does a Charity know about their Donors?
  * Use attr_reader, attr_writer, & attr_accessor
  * Create a run file with a single point of entry
  * Maintain single source of truth for all classes

==============================================================
